      <p>
        As passionate gamers and aspiring game developers, We've always been fascinated by the immersive worlds and captivating experiences that video games offer. This project, the 3D Maze Game, was born out of our desire to create our game and share it with others.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea for this game took shape during our time at Holberton School, where we had the opportunity to dive deep into the world of computer graphics and game development. Throughout our coursework and hands-on projects, we gained a solid foundation in various programming languages, algorithms, and techniques necessary to bring a game to life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspired by classic first-person shooter games and the advancements in raycasting technology, we decided to embark on this project to create a 3D game with a retro aesthetic and challenging gameplay. We wanted to push the boundaries of our skills and showcase our passion for game development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developing this game was a thrilling journey that spanned several weeks. We dedicated countless hours to designing the game mechanics, implementing raycasting algorithms, creating immersive environments, and fine-tuning the gameplay experience. It was a challenging yet rewarding experience that allowed us to combine our creativity and technical skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        We are excited to present this project as our Portfolio Project for Holberton School. It represents the culmination of our learning journey and demonstrates our abilities as a game developer. We hope you enjoy playing the game as much as we enjoyed creating it.
